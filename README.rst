TimeSense
==========

Visual indicator for the passage of time -- Windows Desktop Gadget flavour.

TimeSense is an attempt to create a tool for folks who have difficulty 
sensing the passing of time through a regular analog clock face or 
digital readout. 

This is the Windows Desktop Gadget implementation which describes the 
passage of time with visual cues like progress bars and color shifting.
