TimeSense
==========

An alternative timer for those who have difficulty "seeing" time -- 
Windows Desktop Gadget flavour.

TimeSense is an attempt to create a tool that visualizes times a finite 
resource. Instead of a simple "count down", you can see a progress indicator 
that reduces over time until the target date is reached. For added clarity and 
(potentially) to convey a sense of urgency, the indicator also 
changes color as time passes.


Why? 
-------

I needed a digital "hour glass" that could adapt to counting down events that 
span minutes, hours, weeks, even years. The key element here is the hour-glass(yness?) 
of the tool. 

When the sand passes from one half of an hour glass to the other, it visualizes time 
as a limited resource that is running out. I find this to be way more informative and 
stimulating than a simple countdown of say "10 days to Trade show".

The goal of TimeSense is to convey concise information about the progress towards a 
future event without being overwhelming.
