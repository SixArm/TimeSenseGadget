The dev-cycle automation could be improved by making the install script 
a bit more flexible... Could even become reusable.

1. rename install.cmd to gadget.cmd

2. provide commands 

- during the dev cycle...

> gadget build TimeSense dev
> gadget install TimeSense dev

OR

> gadget boom TimeSense dev

"boom" command does build and install


When ready to ship

> gadget package TimeSense

"package" does build before


3. Should read project config from file so I don't have to type it for all commands?
